| Intro to GitHub | GitHub has long served as one of the most popular collaboration tools for developers. Even so, developing software in collaboration with others can get complicated and confusing. In this session, you will be introduced to the basics of GitHub and the collaboration workflow and learn the importance of version control even for personal projects. Join us to explore the GitHub toolset and begin leveraging it for your own development and collaboration needs. | Wednesday, September 24, 2020 | 1:45 - 2:15pm PDT | [intro-to-github/](https://github.com/sguthals/talkswithdrg/tree/main/2020/ignite/intro-to-github) | [Join Live](https://myignite.microsoft.com/sessions/93f49a5f-71f9-4036-afcf-6cdcbb8abf05) |
| The Data Behind Space Exploration with NASA | Data science is a field that influences all aspects of our scientific community, including space exploration. Inspired by NASA, weâ€™ve developed new content for analyzing space rocks and determining the likelihood of a successful rocket launch into space. Join this session to explore this data and to perhaps develop your own space exploration study using Visual Studio Code and a bit of Python. This session recommends a basic understanding of Visual Studio Code and Python programming. | Wednesday, September 23, 2020 | 3:15 - 3:45pm PDT | [data-in-space/](https://github.com/sguthals/talkswithdrg/tree/main/2020/ignite/data-in-space) | [Join Live](https://myignite.microsoft.com/sessions/d40e4b0f-c832-422f-949a-f82309253704) |
